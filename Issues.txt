Issue #1 - Optimization

As a player, I would like the game to run smoothly, so that it improves my experience.

-[] The game runs more smoothly
-[] It is way easier to position new obstacles
-[] Old methods have been reworked/removed


Issue #2 - Camera movement

As a player, I would like the camera to follow me so that I can see my surroundings more clearly.

-[] The camera moves with the player
-[] The camera is centered on the player


Issue #3 - Pseudo-infinite map

As a player, I would like the map to seem infinite, so that I have more freedom of movement.

-[] The map consists of generated 8x8 chunks that all have 1 or 2 obstacles inside of them
-[] There is a border at the end of every chunk



Issue #4 - Enemies spawning around the player

As a player, I would like enemies to spawn around me so that I have to deal with them while also thinking about where I'm going.

-[] The enemies spawn in a circle around the player
-[] The enemies don't spawn somewhere they're not supposed to, for example outside of the map, or in an obstacle
